# Syscall

A minimal **sudo-like privilege elevation tool for Linux**, written in **Python + C**  
with **PAM authentication** and **system-wide secure password caching**.

Syscall acts as a clean, lightweight alternative to sudo/doas while keeping strict  
security boundaries. Authentication is performed via PAM, and a secure C setuid helper  
executes privileged commands safely.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **PAM-based password authentication**  
- 🕒 **System-wide privilege cache** (shared across all terminals)
- 👥 User must be added to **group wheel** to be authorized.
- ⚙️ **Execute commands as root:**
```bash
syscall <command>
```
or
```bash
sycall <command>
```
- ⏱ **Temporary root access** via privilege cache:
- Enable root access for a limited time:
```bash
syscall --enable <minutes>
```
- Disable the temporary root access manually:
```bash
syscall --disable
```
- Check the current status of the root access cache:
```bash
syscall --status
```

## 🚀 Usage

Run any command as root via syscall:

Update system packages
```bash
syscall pacman -Syu
```
Restart a system service
```bash
syscall systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

Edit a root-owned file
```bash
syscall vim /etc/hosts
```

### **Installation from AUR**

## 📦 Installation

yay -S syscall
```

paru -S syscall
```
```bash
ame ins syscall
```

### **Manual Installation**

### Manual Install

Clone the repository and build the package manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xraincandy/syscall.git

🔒 Authentication Cache

Syscall stores authentication securely using a root-owned state file accessed
through the setuid helper. Once authenticated, you won’t be prompted again until
the cache expires.
