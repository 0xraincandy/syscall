A minimal **sudo-like privilege elevation tool for Linux**, written in **Python + C**  
with **PAM authentication** and **system-wide secure password caching**.

Syscall acts as a clean, lightweight alternative to sudo/doas while keeping strict  
security boundaries. Authentication is performed via PAM, and a secure C setuid helper  
executes privileged commands safely.
